- make everything draggable; add target boxes
- force regeneration on clone (just specify hash?)
- auto-trigger redeploy on Sensor-Watch updates (how?)
- fix frontend so it looks prettier
- make fly io two stage build
- deploy automatically on merge to main
- overload protection? Simplest would be bail immediately on low memory with a 500.
- multi-region? Back onto S3 or S3 clone? CDN?
  (requires baking commit into location hash, probably)
