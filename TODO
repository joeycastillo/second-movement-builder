- fix frontend so it's somewhat pleasant (drag and drop, etc.)
- make fly io two stage build
- deploy automatically on merge to main
- show recent builds / links to them
- do some kind of overload detection (stop submitting jobs if
  we have too many already)
- multi-region? Back onto S3 or S3 clone? CDN?
  (requires baking commit into location hash, probably)
- automatically extract faces on build, and auto-trigger
  redeploy on Sensor-Watch updates (how?)
